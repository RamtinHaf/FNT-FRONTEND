You as the user has the opportunity to write \n            a claim or some news that you want to check how much it has spread on the social media platforms Twitter and Reddit.\n          </dd> \n\n          <dt id=\"faq-q2\">How does search work?</dt> \n          <dd class=\"faq-element-contents\">\n            The search works by the user writes in a query or chooses a predefined query. When the user activates the chosen query, it will be sent a call to the back end \n            to retrive all of the data that is going to be displayed to the user. The defined query must be in the tweet or post on reddit to be sent back from the back end.\n            After the data is loaded the user can go the the dashboard where all of the data is displayed in different charts and graphs.\n          </dd> \n\n          <dt id=\"faq-q3\">What does the different charts and graphs display?</dt> \n          <dd class=\"faq-element-contents\">\n            In the dashboards you as the user will see a few different charts and graphs that is retrieved from the query chosen. The charts are different between the Twitter dashboard and the Reddit dashboard. \n            If you are wondering what the different charts are displaying you can use the tooltip above the chart marked by a question sign.\n          </dd> \n\n          <dt id=\"faq-q4\">Does Forgery News Tracker get back all of the tweets about the query on Twitter?</dt> \n          <dd class=\"faq-element-contents\">\n            No, as per now there is a limit from the Twitter API that restricts us from extracting all of the tweets about the topic. Forgery News Tracker is using the free \n            Twitter API which is resticted to fetching max 100 tweets, we are maximizing the free API by using muliple API calls. But we will never be able to get as many tweets with \n            the free version as the enterprise version would give. In the enterprise version you would get access to all tweets in the archive.\n          </dd> \n\n          <dt id=\"faq-q5\">Why does my query come back as grey with a warning sign?</dt> \n          <dd class=\"faq-element-contents\">\n            The reason query comes back grey with a warning sign is cause of 1 of 2 reasons. 1. The query does not return enough data to display the charts or 2. An error occured in the back end.\n          </dd> \n\n          <dt id=\"faq-q6\">Does Forgery News Tracker tell is a claim is true or false?</dt> \n          <dd class=\"faq-element-contents\">\n            Forgery News Tracker does not do any type of fact checking, this website is only for displaying the spread of fake news. But the query does not have to be a claim that is fake.\n            The search function will also work for all types of queries, for example searching for \"football\" or \"dog\" will return all of the same charts and graphs. But the intent for making\n            this application is to create a tool that could be used to visualize the spread of a false claim or some fake news spreading on social medias. \n          </dd> \n\n          <dt id=\"faq-q7\">Who are the Forgery News Tracker developers?</dt> \n          <dd class=\"faq-element-contents\">\n            Forgery News Tracker is a bachelor thesis for the University of Stavanger Faculty of Science and Technology written by Awalle Mohamed, Jone Lorentzen and Ramtin Hafezinejad\n          </dd> \n\n\n      </dl>\n    </div>\n\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n    name: 'faq',\n    \n};  \n</script>\n\n\n\n<style scoped>\n.faq{\n    color: black;\n    text-align: left;\n}\n.logo{\n   text-align: center;\n   padding-top: 50px;\n}\n\nimg{\n  height: 300px;\n}\n\n.headline h1{\n  font-weight: bold;\n}\n\n.text-container{\n  padding: 50px;\n}\n\n.text-container dd{\n  padding: 10px;\n}\n\n</style>"]}]}
